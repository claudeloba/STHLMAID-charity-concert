## Description

This repository contains the website created for the STHLMAID Charity Concert, a non-profit event held at Trädgården on May 30th, 2024. The concert featured a diverse lineup of artists, including Thomas Stenström, Miriam Bryant, Petter, Daniel Adams-Ray, and many others. All proceeds from the event were donated to the World Food Programme and Plan International.

The code is open-sourced with the hope that it will assist others in creating their own charity concert websites.

The site was developed using Next.js to accommodate the rapidly changing requirements due to the involvement of numerous artists and stakeholders.
